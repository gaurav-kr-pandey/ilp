			<p class="card-text">Dear Students,<br>My name is Rajni Bajpai. I am
				a teacher by profession. Throughout my teaching and life experience
				I come to a conclusion that getting a job is much complex now a day
				than earlier because of the rapid change in the industries and the
				requirements of the user. When student enters in the college some
				new technologies are introduced at the beginning is changed or
				getting deprecated when he takes its degree after four years. And
				the trust of the student in respect to the college is broken
				colleges are also trying to satisfy the students and industry
				people. Hence, we are here. ILP aimed at creating skilled manpower
				in the country by providing quality training programmes in the field
				of ICT. This is humble beginning of training Academic Management
				Committee (AMC). Presently, ILP offers its various training
				programmes through its own training centre and to the college itself
				so that the student Academics will not suffer. As the ICT industry
				is changing rapidly and present structure of computer education in
				colleges and universities is not aligned to the needs of the ICT
				Industry. Students have no place to go and bridge this huge gap
				between ICT industry and Academics. It was this realization that
				prompted me to address this very real need of the student community
				and the Industry itself. We at ILP strongly believe that with the
				right guidance and perfect determination, any student willing to
				learn gets its dream job. All team members at ILP are aces of their
				respective field and the share the highest level of commitment
				towards quality teaching and student success and satisfaction. ILP
				is learning and Placement centre where we teach fundamentals of
				programming to Advanced topic what needed to the college students.
				The courses here are designed to help students with their curriculum
				and give them a real feel of the ICT industry. In the last few
				years, we have helped several students to achieve their goal and
				made them the darling of the industry. At ILP, all our instructors
				are themselves great coders and highly employable in the Industry.
				They decided to join ILP because they are passionate about teaching
				and strongly believe in our vision. Whether you are a student just
				out of school, a college/university student, a working professional
				planning to switch domain to Software/ICT, or just someone wanting
				to enhance ICT skills, I welcome you to join ILP. Basis your
				knowledge and skill, we will shape out a learning path. Wishing you
				success and achievement in your career.</p>
